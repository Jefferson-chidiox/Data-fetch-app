## Project Overview

This project is a sample React application that uses Vite for rapid development and a highly optimized build process. It fetches posts from JSONPlaceholder, enriches them with placeholder images from Picsum.photos, and displays the content using an infinite scrolling mechanism. The application includes debounced search and category filtering, lazy loading of images, and various accessibility improvements to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **React + TypeScript:** Leveraging type safety and component-based architecture.
- **Vite:** Fast development server and build tool.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Automatically loads additional content as the user scrolls.
- **Debounced Search Input:** Reduces unnecessary re-renders for improved performance.
- **Lazy Loading Images:** Images load on-demand as they enter the viewport.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** ARIA labels and keyboard navigability.
- **Theme Toggle:** Allows users to switch between light and dark modes.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-react-app.git
   cd my-react-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running Locally

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`) to view the app.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates the production-ready files in the `dist` folder.

## Deployment

After building the project, deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to your preferred static hosting provider. Some popular options include:

- **Vercel:** [https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/)
- **Netlify:** [https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/)
- **GitHub Pages:** [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

For example, to deploy with Vercel:

1. Install the Vercel CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy your app:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

## Future Enhancements

If given more time, here are some professional improvements that could be implemented:

- **Testing:** Increase test coverage with unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Add more filtering and sorting options, such as multi-select filters or date-based filtering if the API supports it.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Convert the app into a PWA to enable offline support and improve mobile performance.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Integrate performance monitoring tools like Lighthouse or Sentry for continuous tracking of performance and errors.
